# Explore Available Datasets in R

I made this app as an example Shiny app for an introductory workshop I led.

The app lets you select from datasets available in your global environment, view basic information about them, graphically explore data types and missing values, and manipulate some basic plots. 

You can also dynamically change the theme using `bslib::bs_themer()`
